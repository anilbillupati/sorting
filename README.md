Sorting techniques are algorithms used to arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending order. Here are some commonly used sorting techniques:

Bubble Sort: It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, repeatedly passing through the list until the entire list is sorted.

Selection Sort: It selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part of the list and swaps it with the leftmost unsorted element, gradually building the sorted portion of the list.

Insertion Sort: It builds the final sorted list one item at a time by inserting each element into its proper position within the sorted portion of the list.
